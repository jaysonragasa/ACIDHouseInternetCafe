fallin
Janoo Gibbs

a little conversation and turn into little sweet sensation
and there all getting sweeter every time
a friendly get together
and turn into  visions of forever
if i just believed this foolish heart of mine

i cant pretend 
that im just a friend
coz im thinking maybe we were meant to be

i think im fallin falling inlove with you
and i dont i... dont know what to do
im afraid to turn away
but i say it anyway
i think im fallin
(fallin) for you 

whenever were together
i wishin that goodbyes will turn to never
coz with you is where i always wanna be
whenever im beside you 
all i really wanna do
is  hold you
no one else but you
is meant this much to me
